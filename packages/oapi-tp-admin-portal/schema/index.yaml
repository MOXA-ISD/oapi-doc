    Welcome to the ThingsPro Admin Portal RESTful API reference. This is a live document of how you can use ThingsPro Gateway APIs.
    The ThingsPro Gateway API is organized around the [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) methodology, and it uses resource-oriented URLs, and common HTTP response codes to indicate API errors.
